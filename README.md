# 📉 Stock Price Prediction Using RNN (LSTM)

This project uses **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)**, particularly **Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)** networks, to predict stock prices for major tech companies: **Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), IBM**, and **Microsoft (MSFT)**.

## 🎯 Objective

To develop an RNN model for stock price prediction by:

- Cleaning and preparing time-series data
- Creating sequences for supervised learning
- Building and training LSTM models
- Evaluating model performance
- Visualizing predictions

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- NumPy & Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow / Keras
- Matplotlib & Seaborn

##Model Summary
LSTM-based neural network trained for each stock

Used MinMaxScaler for normalization

Evaluated using RMSE and visual plots

Predictions show trends similar to actual values with room for further tuning

##Each company's stock was predicted separately using LSTM. Below is a summary of model effectiveness:

Company	Model Used	Notable Outcome
AMZN	LSTM	Captured upward trend
GOOGL	LSTM	Predicted general movement
IBM	LSTM	Less accurate, needs tuning
MSFT	LSTM	Reasonable trend match
