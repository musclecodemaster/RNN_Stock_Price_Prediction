RNN-Based Stock Price Prediction
This project applies Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN), specifically LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory), to predict stock prices for four major companies: Amazon (AMZN), Google (GOOGL), IBM, and Microsoft (MSFT). It utilizes historical stock data from 2006 to 2018.

📊 Objective
To predict stock prices using RNN-based models and compare them with baseline models. Key tasks include:

Data preprocessing & normalization

Train/test data split

RNN (LSTM) model development

Model evaluation

Visualizations of predictions vs actuals

✅ Technologies Used
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

TensorFlow / Keras

Matplotlib / Seaborn

📈 Model Highlights
Used LSTM layers with dropout regularization

Trained separately on each stock

Plotted predicted vs actual stock prices

Achieved meaningful trends in prediction though improvement is possible

🔍 Results
Results show that while the model captures stock price trends to some extent, additional tuning, feature engineering, or hybrid models may further improve performance.
